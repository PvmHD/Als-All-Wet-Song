Created by Yan Gorshtenin:

Two switch statements are nested inside a for loop. One of the switch statements used break statements; the other switch statement uses fall-through. As the value of the for loop's counter variable goes from 1 to 2 and the to 3, all the cases in the switch statements are executed. When the program is near the end of its run and execution has droppd out of the for loop, the programs last four statements print the songs final verse.
